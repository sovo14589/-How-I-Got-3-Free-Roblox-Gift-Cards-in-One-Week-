### **Day 1: Signing Up for Legitimate Reward Apps**

The first thing I did was sign up for **reward apps** that allow you to earn points by completing simple tasks like watching videos, taking surveys, and playing games. This was my first step in earning free Roblox gift cards.

#### Apps I Used:
- **Swagbucks**: This app allows you to earn points (called **SB**) for various tasks such as watching short videos, searching the web, or completing special offers. You can redeem SB for a variety of gift cards, including Roblox gift cards.
  
- **InboxDollars**: InboxDollars works similarly to Swagbucks, offering cash for activities like reading emails, watching videos, and playing games. I’ve used this app before, so I knew it was a reliable source to earn points for gift cards.

#### What I Did:
- After creating accounts on both platforms, I spent the first day **watching a few videos** and **completing short surveys**. The tasks were simple and didn’t take much time.
- On Swagbucks, I accumulated **300 SB** by watching about 15 minutes of video content. On InboxDollars, I earned **$5** by completing various tasks, which I could exchange for a **$5 gift card**.

**Tip**: I made sure to sign up for **daily bonuses** on both platforms to maximize my earnings. Many reward apps offer bonus points just for logging in every day!

### **Day 2-3: Participating in Free Roblox Giveaways**

On the second day, I decided to join a couple of **Roblox giveaways**. There are always **plenty of Roblox influencers** and **gaming YouTubers** who host giveaways, and I’ve won before, so I figured it was worth trying again.

#### How I Found Giveaways:
- I followed several **Roblox YouTubers** and **Twitch streamers** who frequently hold giveaways for free Robux or Roblox gift cards. Some of the channels I follow have thousands of subscribers, but the giveaways usually require simple actions like liking a post, commenting, and subscribing to their channel.

#### What I Did:
- I entered **three giveaways** on YouTube and Instagram. The instructions were simple: like the video, subscribe to the channel, and comment my Roblox username for a chance to win. 

While there’s always a chance that you won’t win, I got **lucky**—on the third day, I received a message from one of the YouTubers saying I’d won a **$10 Roblox gift card**! 

**Tip**: To increase your chances of winning, follow the giveaway instructions exactly. Some giveaways may have extra opportunities if you share the post with friends or tag people in the comments.

### **Day 4-5: Using MyPoints for Extra Points**

I didn’t stop there! On days 4 and 5, I decided to use **MyPoints**, a popular rewards platform that’s similar to Swagbucks.

#### What I Did:
- I signed up for **MyPoints** and completed a few easy tasks. By simply **watching ads** and **taking quick surveys**, I earned enough points to redeem a **$10 gift card** for **Roblox**.

#### Apps I Used:
- **Mistplay**: This is a mobile app where you can earn points by playing Android games. You can then redeem those points for gift cards, including Roblox gift cards.
- **FeaturePoints**: Similar to Mistplay, FeaturePoints lets you earn rewards by downloading and playing apps, and the points can be redeemed for **Roblox gift cards**.
